# Simple Todo App

This project is a web based "To do" app that allows users to set goals and track progress.

## Functionality

The app is initialized with some default tasks that we deem relevant to our particular users. It has a check box that toogles as checked or unchecked, along with a delete button to remove tasks and maintain a clean dashboard. The "Add Todo" button allows users to create a new task by opening a modal where task name and deadline date are required as inputs. The inputs are validated and the submit button is toggled off until the inputs are satisfactory. Once the new card is created the inputs and error messages are cleared back to default and the button within the modal is once again inactive.
